Harry Potter lives with his abusive aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and their bullying son, Dudley.
 Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded off his forehead and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Unknown to Harry, he is famous in the wizarding world.
At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first-years among four school Houses .
 Harry comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry.
